# WebApp-Scripts
These are some scripts from Web App Development from Spring 2023.
___
`makeflask` is the first script.
It creates a directory to be used as the root of the development environment for that Flask app it creates necessary subdirectories for Flask to run properly and creates an `app.py` with a simple home/index page.
It also has some extra things from WAD 2023 such as database integration.


`makehtml` is the second script.
It creates a template HTML page to be used by `app.py` in order to display a "proper" web page.
